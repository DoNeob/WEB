      Ratchet & Clank is a series of action platformer and third-person shooter video games. The franchise was created and developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation consoles, such as PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 with the exclusion of Size Matters and Secret Agent Clank, which were developed by High Impact Games for the PlayStation Portable. Every game in the series has only been released for Sony platforms, as the intellectual property is owned by Sony Computer Entertainment. An animated feature film adaptation produced by Rainmaker Entertainment and Blockade Entertainment and distributed by Focus Features and Gramercy Pictures was released on April 29, 2016.

  The games take place in a science fiction setting and follow the adventures of Ratchet (a feline-like humanoid known as a Lombax, who is a mechanic) and Clank (a diminutive, sentient Zoni robot) as they travel through the universe, saving it from evil forces that consistently threaten it. The series is noted for its inclusion of many exotic, unique and over-the-top weapons and gadgets, a concept that Insomniac Games has also expanded into their other games.
